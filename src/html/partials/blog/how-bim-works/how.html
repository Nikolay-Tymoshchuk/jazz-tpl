  <h2 class="blog__title">How to speed up the BIM process adoption</h2>
  <p class="blog-section__description">
    Despite all the positive outcomes and benefits of BIM adoption, the BIM implementation process still comes with
    significant challenges. The main roadblocks that negatively impact the BIM process are contractorsâ€™
    unwillingness to
    work with the BIM tools and a lack of BIM expertise in the AEC organizations. One of the reasons why contractors
    might
    not want to work with BIM is their bad habit of padding their cost estimates. Replacing the contractor might
    help here.

  <p>
    The lack of BIM skills in-house is harder to correct, so many companies decide to opt for external help. When
    considering BIM outsourcing vs in-house team, the AEC companies discover they can work in synergy with BIM
    service
    providers. This greatly empowers their project capabilities, reduces long-term expenses, and ensures timely
    project
    completion and high NPS scores. So, all you have to do to overcome this roadblock is find a reliable BIM
    partner.
