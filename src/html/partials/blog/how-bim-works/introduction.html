            The Building Information Modeling or BIM process has been around since the
            1970s, but it became pervasive 15 or so years ago. With the evolution of
            cloud infrastructure and Ð¡omputer-Aided Design &lpar;CAD&rpar;, the
            architecture, engineering, and construction &lpar;AEC&rpar; professionals
            saw considerable improvements in their project workflows.

            Today, the BIM design process is supported by government contracts and
            large AEC companies across the globe, which further spurs its
            industry-wide adoption. However, many AEC businesses still consider BIM
            modeling to be a tool for the rich only, which is not true.

            up the BIM process in your company, and highlight potential roadblocks
