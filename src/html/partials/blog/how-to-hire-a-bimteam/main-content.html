    As a result, the question for most architectural firms is not just whether
    they need BIM but how to implement it well.

    can completely transform the way your buildings are designed and built. In
    this article, we'll discuss what makes BIM so attractive to the industry and
    how to choose and hire a BIM team for a top-notch result.
  </p>
  <p>So let’s get started.</p>
  <h2 class="blog__title" id="howtohire-vdc2">Why do you need a BIM team?</h2>
  <p>
    So why do you need a BIM team? The short answer is, BIM implementation is no
    longer an option for companies that want to remain competitive. Alongside
    the many benefits BIM brings to the table, BIM implementation will soon
    become mandatory for the industry as government enforcement increases.
  </p>
  <h2 class="blog__title-normal">Government pressure</h2>
  <p>
    Governments worldwide are working to increase BIM adoption. In the UK, BIM
    has been mandatory for all public projects since 2016, after it saved the
    country
    <a
      class="blog__text-link blog__text-underline blog__text-cursive"

      >15-20% of construction costs</a
    >
    . Germany is preparing for the transition to BIM workflows, while France
    aims to adopt BIM by 2022, and Italy plans to make BIM mandatory even for
    small-budget projects (less than 1 million euros) by 2025.
  </p>
  <p>
    Trends in the USA are following suit. Since 2006, BIM has been

      >mandatory</a
    >
    for all US Army contractors, and BIM is required at different degrees in
    states including Wisconsin, Texas, and California.
  </p>
  <p>
    In summary, with the growing number of countries embracing BIM, it’s only a
    matter of time until BIM becomes mandatory in your state or country. And if
    you don’t want to wait, there are plenty of other reasons to consider
    setting up a BIM team soon.

  <p>
    Any given construction project can involve hundreds of specialists working
    on different tasks simultaneously. It’s a no-brainer that we want all
    parties to communicate fast and efficiently, but in reality, project
    communication often turns into this:

    A BIM team solves this problem in part because it focuses on the
    communication process between clients, designers, architects, and other
    teams. A dedicated team can bridge information gaps and keep everyone’s
    requirements on the table.
  </p>
  <p>Effective communication results in better outcomes too:</p>
  <ul class="blog__list">
    <li class="blog__item-arrow">
      <span class="blog__text-strong"> Highly accurate visualization</span> . A
      BIM team combines graphical and non-graphical data, documentation, and
      other project details into a single digital model, so you can be sure that
      everyone has a clear understanding of what the project looks like.
    </li>
    <li class="blog__item-arrow">
      <span class="blog__text-strong">Enhanced collaboration and control </span>
      . BIM enables all engaged teams — including designers, architects, and
      business owners — to bring their expertise and stay up to date with the
      project both on site and remotely.
    </li>
    <li class="blog__item-arrow">
      <span class="blog__text-strong">Fewer errors and rework </span> . A BIM
      composite model enables fast and smooth redraws or redesigns whenever you
      need them and uses patterns to automate relevant procedures.
    </li>
    <li class="blog__item-arrow">
      <span class="blog__text-strong">Reduced risk </span> . Digital modeling
      prevents design conflicts and ensures that a project’s specifications
      comply with safety and quality regulations.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The upshot is that whether you want to improve project visualization, reduce
    the number of errors and rework, or avoid risks,
    <span class="blog__text-strong">hiring BIM engineers </span> is a logical
    choice. The next step is creating a team that can work together effectively.

    What are BIM team roles and responsibilities?
  </h2>
  <p>
    The structure of a BIM team can vary depending on your company size, the
    nature of your projects, and your level of BIM adoption. In a small company,
    a BIM specialist may be able to fulfill all roles simultaneously, but this
    is rarely effective in the long run. Once your projects and company begin to
    grow, communication difficulties and increasing workloads become a problem.
  </p>
  <p>
    The best strategy is to work with a BIM team composed of several specialists
    — a manager, coordinator, and engineer. We’ll look at these roles in more
    detail below, but first, here’s a breakdown of their responsibilities:

  <h2 class="blog__title" id="howtohire-vdc4">BIM manager</h2>
  <p>
    A BIM manager is responsible for implementing BIM and digital procedures in
    your company and organizing the general workflow. Managers may not have deep
    technical expertise in BIM modeling itself, but they should be aware of the
    relevant technology for coordination and training. This means that they need
    a strong understanding of construction, and they should be well-versed in
    BIM processes.
  </p>
  <h2 class="blog__title-normal">Skills</h2>
  <p>
    Managers should be experienced in working with relevant management software
    (for example, usBIM). Depending on your company requirements, managers may
    also need to work with integrated systems or platforms for collaboration and
    file management.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you’re about to
    <span class="blog__text-strong">hire a BIM Manager </span> , consider your
    candidate’s soft skills along with their technical knowledge. They should
    have:
  </p>
  <ul class="blog__list">
    <li class="blog__item-arrow">
      <span class="blog__text-strong">A big-picture perspective </span> for
      communication with specialists regardless of whether they are engineers,
      designers, or stakeholders
    </li>
    <li class="blog__item-arrow">
      <span class="blog__text-strong">Excellent communication skills </span> for
      effective collaboration
    </li>
    <li class="blog__item-arrow">
      <span class="blog__text-strong">Teaching skills </span> to cooperate with
      people at different levels of understanding and to help people overcome a
      fear of change
    </li>
    <li class="blog__item-arrow">
      <span class="blog__text-strong">Good business sense </span> so that they
      can effectively prioritize tasks and problems
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="blog__title-normal">Experience</h2>
  <p>
    Managers need strong experience in the construction process, BIM
    implementation, and workflow setup. Ideally, they will have worked in a
    variety of positions previously so that they can understand the process from
    different perspectives.
  </p>
  <h2 class="blog__title-normal">Salary expectations</h2>
  <p>
    According to

      >Glassdoor</a
    >
    , the average annual salary of a BIM manager in the US is $86,538. The
    salary ranges from $60,000 to $124,000.
  </p>
  <h2 class="blog__title" id="howtohire-vdc5">BIM coordinator</h2>
  <p>
    <span class="blog__text-strong">BIM coordinator responsibilities </span>
    involve work on specific projects, such as verifying the correctness of a
    BIM model, detecting clashes, and coordinating the project’s workflow from
    design to construction. If your project is large, you may need several
    coordinators to work effectively, but if it’s small, you could
    <span class="blog__text-strong">outsource the BIM coordinator role</span>
    or appoint a lead BIM engineer instead.
  </p>
  <h2 class="blog__title-normal">Skills</h2>
  <p>
    Coordinators should have strong expertise in BIM technologies to provide
    technical support and mentoring for the project teams. This includes
    experience in software for automation, collaboration, model verification
    (code checking and clash detection), and coordination — some examples are
    Tekla BIMSight, Grasshopper, Navisworks, and Solibri Model Checker. On top
    of this, coordinators should be enthusiastic about learning and leveraging
    new technologies and methods.
  </p>
  <p>
    Alongside having software proficiency, coordinators should understand and be
    able to apply methodologies such as Virtual Design and Construction (VDC),
    the ICE Scoring Model, and the Last Planner System.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you <span class="blog__text-strong">hire a BIM coordinator </span> ,
    look for candidates with soft skills similar to those we described for a
    manager role. Just like managers, coordinators collaborate with different
    specialists, and they need to be able to see the project from different
    perspectives to link and coordinate submodels.
  </p>
  <h2 class="blog__title-normal">Experience</h2>
  <p>
    Coordinators need a high level of technical experience to understand
    software potential and limits.

  <h2 class="blog__title" id="howtohire-vdc6">BIM engineer</h2>
  <p>
    This role can have different names, such as BIM technician, modeler,
    engineer, or specialist. BIM engineer responsibilities involve the actual
    construction of BIM models. For smaller projects, one engineer may be in
    charge of architectural, structural, and MEP systems modeling. If your
    project is larger, you can consider hiring a BIM engineer for each task.
  </p>
  <h2 class="blog__title-normal">Skills</h2>
  <p>
    Engineers should have strong expertise in BIM software such as Autodesk
    Revit and AutoCAD, and be proficient in architectural design and system
    modeling, structural and energy calculations, robotic processing automation
    (RPA), and augmented and virtual reality visualization. They should also be
    experienced enough to comply with VDC, ICE, and Last Planner procedures set
    by coordinators.
  </p>
  <h2 class="blog__title-normal">Experience</h2>
  <p>
    Required experience for engineers will depend on your project’s complexity
    and your need for specific technical expertise.
  </p>
  <h2 class="blog__title-normal">Salary expectations</h2>

    is from $38,000 to $79,000.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course, this is not an exhaustive list of BIM specialist requirements,
    but it’s a good start for narrowing down your list of candidates. If
    recruitment feels impractical or overwhelming, it’s time to consider
    outsourcing to a pre-formed BIM team.

    Outsource instead of hiring in-house
  </h2>
  <p>
    Hiring in-house is the most straightforward approach that many companies
    use, but is it the best one? The answer is: it depends.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you’re a large company that’s willing to spend the time and energy
    required to get full control over a dedicated and local team of experts,
    in-house makes sense. The problems begin when time and money become a
    priority in your BIM recruitment strategy. Often, hiring in-house involves
    hidden costs and higher competition for a limited number of local
    specialists.

  <p>For example, with an in-house approach, the main disadvantages are:</p>
  <ul class="blog__list">
    <li class="blog__item-arrow">
      <span class="blog__text-strong">Higher recruitment costs </span> .
      Recruiting the right people takes time and extra manpower, and you’re tied
      to local salary rates.
    </li>
    <li class="blog__item-arrow">
      <span class="blog__text-strong">Higher overheads </span> . Costs increase
      as you pay for annual software licenses (which can run into the
      thousands), staff training, on-site server maintenance, and so on.
    </li>
    <li class="blog__item-arrow">
      <span class="blog__text-strong">Loss of time </span> . Workflow can be
      inefficient during onboarding.
    </li>
    <li class="blog__item-arrow">
      <span class="blog__text-strong">A lack of local talent </span> . You may
      run into limited expertise or a lack of specific skills for certain
      projects.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Outsourcing helps you overcome all these challenges. In particular, by
    choosing to work with a BIM service provider, you get:
  </p>
  <ul class="blog__list">
    <li class="blog__item-arrow">
      <span class="blog__text-strong"
        >Access to a vetted global talent pool
      </span>
      . You aren’t limited to your location and can work with the world's best
      professionals. What’s more, outsourced teams are usually more
      knowledgeable of BIM tools and better aware of industry innovations and
      best practices.
    </li>
    <li class="blog__item-arrow">
      <span class="blog__text-strong">Shorter recruitment times </span> . You
      choose and hire your service provider just once and leave the rest to
      them. The provider assigns you a pre-formed team with a polished workflow,
      ready to work on your project from day one.
    </li>
    <li class="blog__item-arrow">
      <span class="blog__text-strong">Project continuity </span> . Whenever your
      project requires team restructuring, a higher workload, or rare skill
      expertise, your provider accommodates it without affecting the project
      timeline.
    </li>
    <li class="blog__item-arrow">
      <span class="blog__text-strong">A reduced administrative burden </span> .
      You focus on the project while the provider handles issues such as staff
      training and certification, payrolls, medical coverage, and software
      licensing.
    </li>
  </ul>
