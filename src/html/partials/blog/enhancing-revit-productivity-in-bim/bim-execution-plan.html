  <h2 class="blog__title">BIM execution plan (BEP)</h2>
  <p>
    BIM projects contain tons of information about every object and asset in
    construction. So much, in fact, that even experienced engineers have to
    organize this data before starting a project.
  </p>
  <p>
    The tender process starts with the Exchange Information Requirements (EIR) —
    a document detailing the client’s requirements and specifications for each
    BIM project. A typical EIR contains three sections:
  </p>
  <ul class="blog__list">
    <li class="blog__item-arrow">
      <span class="blog__text-strong">Technical.</span> This section lists
      requirements for software platforms (CDE, CAFM, and CAD), data exchange
      formats (documents, images, CAD files, tabular, asset, and data analysis),
      geometric data coordinate systems, level of information (level of
      development), and training (for tools provided by the supplier).
    </li>
    <li class="blog__item-arrow">
      <span class="blog__text-strong">Management.</span> This part establishes
      processes and procedures for information exchange, data segregation,
      communication strategies, and security measures. Additionally, it lists
      the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders.
    </li>
    <li class="blog__item-arrow">
      <span class="blog__text-strong">Commercial.</span> This section defines the
      strategic purposes of the information provided (for operations,
      maintenance, repair, compliance, and other processes), data drops (which
      must align with the work plan), and project deliverables.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Contractors participating in the tender will respond to the EIR with
    pre-contract BIM execution plans (BEPs) — a document that outlines planned
    goals, key project milestones, and deliverable strategy. The client will use
    a pre-contract BEP to assess the contractor’s approach, capabilities, and
    competence.
  </p>
  <p>
    The client and awarded contractor will then create a post-contract BEP
    containing agreed roles, responsibilities, strategies, milestones, and
    working procedures. A well-defined plan can provide significant advantages
    for your construction project, including:
  </p>
  <ul class="blog__list">
    <li class="blog__item-arrow">
      Efficient data exchange via secure communication platforms
    </li>
    <li class="blog__item-arrow">
      Improved communication and collaboration between stakeholders across the
      project’s lifecycle
    </li>
    <li class="blog__item-arrow">
      Faster turnaround time with a tighter focus on key deliverables
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In summary, a detailed BEP should be your guide throughout the BIM project.
    Now, let’s see how you can improve the efficiency of your BIM workflow with
    standards and templates.
