    <h2 class="blog__title">Takeaway: BIM outsourcing is a viable choice</h2>

    <p>
        The main idea when considering BIM outsourcing vs in-house team is that it’s better to work with remote experts
        rather
        than have no expertise on-site or suffer the growing pains of starting your own team. Throughout the course of
        this
        article, we’ve shown numerous advantages of BIM outsourcing and how it helps overcome the shortcomings of
        in-house BIM.

        Hopefully, you can now see the benefits of working with a dedicated BIM team — from cost savings up to instant
        access to
        necessary skills. Outsourcing companies have a more broad BIM modeling expertise, so collaboration between
        outsourced
        specialists and your in-house team leads to synergy and great collaboration.
