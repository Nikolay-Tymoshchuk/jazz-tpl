        The benefits of VDC and why you need to implement it.
    </h2>

    <p>
        When it comes to virtual design and construction, benefits may vary
        depending on the project&apos;s scale and specifics, as well as the depth and
        quality of VDC implementation.<br />
        However, there are three key aspects VDC always has a positive impact on&colon;
    </p>

        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>These gains are achieved by&colon;</p>

    <ul class="blog__list">
        <li class="blog__item-arrow">
            <span class="blog__text-strong">More accurate project estimates help land new contracts.</span>
            Thanks to the advanced techniques of data aggregation and processing, VDC
            software can generate detailed models and assess the project from every
            angle with unprecedented speed and accuracy. This is a tangible advantage
            in the pre&ndash;construction phase, as it immediately provides owners with
            accurate budgets.
        </li>
        <li class="blog__item-arrow">
            <span class="blog__text-strong">Collaboration during pre&ndash;planning prevents errors.</span>
            With access to high&ndash;quality models and conflict detection features, teams
            can work in the BIM&sol;VDC environment simultaneously and prevent errors that
            would otherwise incur additional expenses.
        </li>
        <li class="blog__item-arrow">
            <span class="blog__text-strong">Effective communication results in better quality and reduced
                delays</span>
            Changes are inevitable, and they can occur during the planning phase or
            mid&ndash;project. BIM&sol;VDC models and applications enable the interdisciplinary
            teams to quickly exchange information and make adjustments on the go. The
            time saved translates into more revenue.
        </li>
        <li class="blog__item-arrow">
            <span class="blog__text-strong">Adhering to VDC workflows enhances construction safety.</span>
            The use of high&ndash;precision virtual environments can help identify safety
            concerns before and during construction. Safety requirements can then be
            implemented and conveyed to employees more efficiently during all phases
            of development.
        </li>
        <li class="blog__item-arrow">
            <span class="blog__text-strong">3D visualizations increase stakeholder engagement.</span>
            Not everyone is good at interpreting blueprints and complex construction
            plans. Seeing a realistic virtual building design, however, is another
            story. This is a great way to keep all stakeholders informed, happy, and
            confident.

        These are some of the significant benefits using the VDC methodology and
        software can bring. Don&apos;t forget &ndash; the VDC ecosystem can also utilize the
        latest technical means in construction like laser scanners and drones. Data
        gathered from those sources is incorporated into the model, which allows
        even better control over the project. The choice of BIM&sol;VDC workflows and
        technology to be implemented is entirely in the hands of business owners and
        executive management.
