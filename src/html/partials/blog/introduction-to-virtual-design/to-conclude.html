        The AEC sector has seen a number of major disruptions in the past two
        decades alone. Today, the industry must embrace innovation, and the timing
        is perfect&colon;
        <span class="blog__text-underline">Deloitte&apos;s research</span> shows that 76&percnt;
        of AEC executives are ready to invest in digital solutions in 2021. The
        longer it takes for architecture, engineering, and construction businesses
        to upgrade to modern BIM and VDC processes, the higher the cost they&apos;ll
        eventually pay. It&apos;s time to give some serious thought to the topic and
        start looking for a reliable BIM & VDC services provider.
