            The AEC &#40;Architectural Engineering and Construction&#41; industry
            deals with projects of incredible complexity. They are time-consuming,
            require significant resources, and involve multiple parties that need to
            be coordinated flawlessly. Yet, AEC companies are somewhat reluctant when
            it comes to changing their processes, and the pace of innovation remains
            comparatively slow in the sector. According to this report, the ones that
            are embracing new tech and inviting outside software experts find
            themselves ahead of the competition with significantly improved team
            coordination.

            A number of digital initiatives are helping AEC companies cut losses and
            maximize efficiency, and Virtual Design and Construction &#40;VDC&#41;
            tops the list. This innovative technology-backed approach to planning and
            construction revolutionizes the entire process.
