        How are AEC companies using virtual design and construction&#63;
    </h2>

    <p>
        VDC is a sophisticated methodology that employs the latest software,
        hardware, and management practices. While many business owners perceive VDC
        as too costly and convoluted, in reality, any AEC company can use the VDC
        approach to optimize each phase of the engineering and construction process.
        There is no magic &#8211; just a balanced and logical system that works every
        time.
    </p>
    <p>
        These are the essential components of the VDC framework and what they&apos;re
        built to achieve&#58;

        <li class="blog__item-arrow">
            <span class="blog__text-strong">Client objectives.</span>
            The team needs to collaborate with the client to develop clearly defined,
            measurable objectives before the project takes off. After deciding what
            has to be done to achieve the client&apos;s vision, plans are made to determine
            exactly how the team should proceed. This module of VDC specifies and
            measures metrics like the project&apos;s lifecycle costs, schedules, etc.

            <span class="blog__text-strong">Building Information Modeling &lpar;BIM&rpar;.</span>
            Before starting the actual procurement and construction work at the site,
            a virtual 3D model of the project is created based on the requirements and
            data collected during the initial planning phase. BIM serves as a product
            design tool that describes the project&apos;s content in great detail and
            tracks all interdependencies within the framework.
        </li>
        <li class="blog__item-arrow">
            <span class="blog__text-strong">Integrated Concurrent Engineering &lpar;ICE&rpar;.</span>
            Stakeholders participate in virtual meetings and project teams conduct
            design and engineering work using 3D modeling technologies. Done regularly
            and in real&#8211;time, this ensures effective decision&#8211;making and dramatically
            facilitates interdisciplinary collaboration.
        </li>
        <li class="blog__item-arrow">
            <span class="blog__text-strong">Product Production Management &lpar;PPM&rpar;.</span>
            Used to describe the production process, this module is a standardized way
            to specify milestones, responsibilities, and workflows for the teams. This
            is invaluable for keeping everyone working together and within budgets.
        </li>
        <li class="blog__item-arrow">
            <span class="blog__text-strong">Project objectives.</span>
            It&apos;s important to formulate a comprehensive definition of the project&apos;s
            outcome, along with the respective teams&apos; commitments. Assessing the
            progress at defined intervals is equally crucial to prevent unwanted
            delays and financial losses.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        As you can see, the VDC approach equips every participant of an AEC project
        with all necessary tools to perform their functions most efficiently. The
        advantages of the method are becoming apparent, and it&apos;s a good time to list
        them explicitly.
