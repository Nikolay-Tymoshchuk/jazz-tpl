    <h2 class="blog__title">Working with an outsourced BIM team</h2>

    <p>
        Here’s a look at how working with a BIM outsourcing service provider helps
        you handle or completely avoid the challenges listed above, one-on-one.
    </p>

    <ul class="blog__list ">
        <li class="blog__item-arrow">
            <span class="blog__text-strong">High team member skill level.</span>
            A BIM outsourcing service provider will invest in improving their
            employees' skills and certify them appropriately to кeep them relevant and
            competitive.
        </li>

        <li class="blog__item-arrow">
            <span class="blog__text-strong">Access to a global talent pool.</span>
            Instead of looking for unemployed BIM experts locally or headhunting them
            from your competitors, you get instant access to a vast pool of skilled
            BIM specialists.
        </li>

        <li class="blog__item-arrow">
            <span class="blog__text-strong">Broad toolset expertise.</span>
            Outsourced teams usually have a working knowledge of many BIM tools. Most
            importantly, they’ll be able to recommend the best tool kit to solve the
            challenges of your particular project and integrate it with your existing
            software ecosystem.
        </li>

        <li class="blog__item-arrow">
            <span class="blog__text-strong">A turnkey team with polished workflows.</span>
            The team is pre-formed and ready to start working on your project from day
            one.
        </li>

        <li class="blog__item-arrow">
            <span class="blog__text-strong">Ensured project continuity.</span>
            Hiring new talent or replacing existing members is not your headache. The
            BIM service provider is under contractual obligation to deliver the
            results on time.
        </li>

        <li class="blog__item-arrow">
            <span class="blog__text-strong">No CAPEX, payroll package, or software licensing concerns.</span>
            The provider takes care of the office space and the hardware and software
            licenses needed for your team to work. It also handles medical coverage
            and operational overheads.
        </li>

        <li class="blog__item-arrow">
            <span class="blog__text-strong">No time lost, and an instant services upgrade.</span>
            A reliable BIM provider and a signed contract guarantee you get value from
            day one and don’t miss out on business opportunities due to lack of
            skills.
        </li>

        <li class="blog__item-arrow">
            <span class="blog__text-strong">Guaranteed delivery of results.</span>
            If a team member falls ill, goes on vacation, or quits, it’s the service
            provider’s responsibility to replace them, so still, you get all the
            project deliverables and documentation on time.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        As you can see, there are multiple positive aspects of working with a
        reliable technology partner even before your project is running.

        Let's now look at some specific BIM outsourcing pros — all the good things
        you get with this way of working.
    </p>

    <h3 class="blog__item-title">Advantages of BIM outsourcing</h3>

    <ul class="blog__list outsource__list">
        <li class="blog__item-arrow">
            You pay only for the time the team actually spends working on your
            project, not for idle standby. This results in significant cost reduction,
            as compared to running an in-house BIM team.
        </li>
        <li class="blog__item-arrow">
            One-time project or long-term partnership? You choose. With outsourcing,
            you select the approach based on how satisfied you are with the outcomes.
            If you find a reliable BIM outsourcing partner, you’ve gained a
            significant advantage over your competitors.
        </li>
        <li class="blog__item-arrow">
            The service provider handles all the project management issues, and you
            are kept updated with regular reports through your preferred communication
            channels. This lets you keep your finger on the pulse of the project
            without investing too much time and effort.
        </li>
        <li class="blog__item-arrow">
            A BIM service provider’s expertise will help automate repetitive tasks,
            bringing down project delivery time and costs.
        </li>
        <li class="blog__item-arrow">
            The service provider prepares detailed project documentation to help your
            team use the deliverables produced (point cloud to 3D models/2D drawings,
            BIM content, BIM automation, etc.). All the IP rights on the project
            results belong to you under NDA and SLA.
        </li>
        <li class="blog__item-arrow">
            If, despite everything, you’re dissatisfied with the project results and
            wish to move on, this is much easier to do than with an in-house team.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="blog__item-title ">Disadvantages of BIM outsourcing</h3>
    <ul class="blog__list">
        <li class="blog__item-arrow">
            You have little control over who works on your project. The BIM outsourcing company assigns the team for
            every project
            and handles any replacements.

        </li>
        <li class="blog__item-arrow">
            There can be communication challenges if your service provider’s working hours don’t overlap with yours.
            However, this
            can be turned into an advantage in some cases, as you can get many tasks done overnight.

        </li>
        <li class="blog__item-arrow">
            There’s also a risk that a vendor will be unreliable. You can mitigate this to some extent by asking for
            references from
            previous customers to support the claims the company makes. Look for case studies that showcase the team’s
            expertise,
            online reviews, and ratings on niche platforms, etc.

        </li>

    </ul>
    <p>
        The key thing to remember is that just as your reputation is valuable to you in the AEC business, so a reliable
        BIM
        service provider will strive to maintain and acquire good references. Therefore, when you find a competent BIM
        outsourcing company, both parties can benefit from long-term cooperation.
