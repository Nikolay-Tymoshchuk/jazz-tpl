        Here are several more tips that will help you to get the most out of this technology. If you need laser scanning and an accurate as-built model, you can find a surveying company experienced in laser scanning in your area. Next, you can submit the point cloud data to Powerkh so that we scan it to BIM modeling. We are not limited by geography. It means we can model buildings all over the world. Weâ€™ll be happy to assist you, just like we did in more than 200 BIM & VDC projects delivered by Powerkh. Contact us today!
