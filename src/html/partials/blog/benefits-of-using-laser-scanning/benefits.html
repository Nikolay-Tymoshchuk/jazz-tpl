    Why Did the Construction Industry Shift to Laser Scanning?
  </h2>
  <p>
    Just like taking a photo is more accurate and less time-consuming than
    painting a picture, laser scanning is far more efficient than taking
    measurements by hand.
  </p>
  <p>
    Architects and engineers used to visit construction sites to capture
    details, which was tedious and dangerous since some areas were under
    renovation. But in the 1990s, the more effective laser scanning technique
    was first used for site surveying. And since then, the construction industry
    has experienced a shift toward laser scanning.
  </p>
  <p>
    With laser scanning, the need to be physically present for mapping at a
    construction site disappeared – an advantage that’s especially critical
    during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also made scanning inaccessible surfaces
    and complex geometry easier, and that is probably why construction giants
    use laser scanning in their work.

    What Tasks Does Laser Scanning Solve in Construction?
  </h2>
  <p>
    As you already know, laser scanning is used for mapping a design site and
    collecting accurate information about a building project in 2-3 days without
    involving multiple people. Other tasks laser scanning can solve in the
    construction industry are:
  </p>
  <ul class="blog__list">
    <li class="blog__item-arrow">
      <span class="blog__text-strong">Monitoring the construction progress.</span>
      Laser scanning aids in checking building progress and estimating its
      accuracy. Additionally, this technology is beneficial for quality control
      and verifying contract fulfillment.
    </li>
    <li class="blog__item-arrow">
      <span class="blog__text-strong">Mapping site conditions in renovation.</span>
      With 3D laser scanning, the construction team evaluates site conditions in
      renovation projects quickly. It also helps to find errors in construction
      plans and make these plans more accurate. 3D laser scanning helps to
      monitor the accuracy of architectural design and create site
      documentation.
    </li>
    <li class="blog__item-arrow">
      <span class="blog__text-strong">Determining design problems.</span>
      As a construction project progresses, design issues may arise in the form
      of new drawings or changes to a building plan. Laser scanning can help
      construction companies avoid these issues. Also, this technology is used
      to provide precise deliverables as sections, floor plans, elevations, and
      more.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Indeed, laser scanning can help solve specific construction problems, but is
    it really that useful for the entire industry? Short answer: yes!

    How the Construction Industry Benefits from Laser Scanning
  </h2>
  <p>
    Laser scanning helps construction industry players cut costs, streamline the
    building process, and properly evaluate risks. Along with these benefits,
    laser scanning offers:
  </p>
  <ul class="blog__list">
    <li class="blog__item-arrow">
      <span class="blog__text-strong">Improved quality.</span> Using the laser
      scanning technique gives engineering teams the most accurate information
      about building sites. Laser scanning captures internal and external
      details with an accuracy of up to 0.04 inches. This allows creating
      precise architectural projects without having to redo them later.
    </li>
    <li class="blog__item-arrow">
      <span class="blog__text-strong">Reduced costs.</span> Speaking of
      accuracy, precise measurement and swift data collection are the factors
      that reduce costs. According to BuilderSpace, laser scanning saves up to
      10% on building projects. Other than that, by using this technology in
      your building project, you will not have the need to send a construction
      team on the site.
    </li>
    <li class="blog__item-arrow">
      <span class="blog__text-strong">Streamlined collaboration.</span> Laser
      scanning helps to improve collaboration and coordination. When teams
      receive a 3D virtual site overview, they can simultaneously work on it,
      regardless of the location. This helps construction companies improve
      their teams’ collaboration, communication, and decision-making.
    </li>
    <li class="blog__item-arrow">
      <span class="blog__text-strong">Improved design and planning.</span> Laser
      scanning allows construction teams to analyze clashes between site
      conditions and newly added design elements. Plus, it improves the planning
      process, ensures exact site measurements and the materials the
      construction company should use.
      <p>Some building projects require remodeling
        of the existing spaces and architecture. In this case, 3D laser scanning
        is used to create, refine, and realize design ideas. This provides precise
        deliverables as sections, floor plans, elevations, and more.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class="blog__item-arrow">
      <span class="blog__text-strong">Increased speed.</span> No tape measure
      can compete with laser scanning: one scan takes up to two minutes.
      Besides, laser scanning ensures quick access to site details without the
      need to visit a building area since everyone can see all the captured data
      in the office.
    </li>
    <li class="blog__item-arrow">
      <span class="blog__text-strong">Enhanced safety measures.</span> With
      laser scanning, construction companies can improve safety measures during
      the surveying process. For instance, portable laser scanners are effective
      in recording measurements from a 500-meter distance. That keeps the
      construction team safe if they work on potentially hazardous areas.
    </li>
    <li class="blog__item-arrow">
      <span class="blog__text-strong">Enhanced accuracy and flexibility.</span>
      Manual labor is tedious and prone to errors, unlike automatic laser
      scanning. The technology helps to minimize the number of mistakes in the
      construction project. On top of that, laser scanning reduces the time
      spent on building sites, making working processes more flexible.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We hope the benefits of laser scanning have convinced you to give this
    technology a try. If they did, here’s what your next steps should be.
