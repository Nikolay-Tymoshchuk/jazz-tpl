    <p>
        Laser scanning is a method of using laser beams for capturing and mapping spatial dimensions and objects. It results in a detailed and highly accurate 3D representation of the entire building project or site, known as the point cloud.

        Here’s how laser scanning works exactly. A scanner shoots myriads of lasers across 360 degrees that hit every object within the space that’s being scanned. When laser impulse meets the objects, the scanner evaluates the angle and energy of the beams, and that information is used to model the space. The entire process is quick and painless; no wonder laser scanning gained popularity.
