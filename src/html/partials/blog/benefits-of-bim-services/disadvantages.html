        Despite the positive impact of BIM on the construction management industry, the technology isn't perfect. Here's
        what
        some people consider to be its primary drawbacks&colon;

            <h3 class="blog__item-title">01 Demanding technology</h3>

            <p>
                BIM is not just 3D modeling software. BIM technology is a set of software tools and methodologies, which
                are used to
                model graphical and non-graphical interactive databases during the entire life cycle of the project.
            </p>
            <p>
                The components that make up a BIM can evolve during the project’s development phase. Some of the most
                popular modeling
                tools include expensive premium software such as&colon;

            </p>
            <ul class="blog__list">
                <li class="blog__item-arrow">Autodesk Revit</li>
                <li class="blog__item-arrow">Navisworks</li>
                <li class="blog__item-arrow">Dynamo</li>
                <li class="blog__item-arrow">SYNCHRO Pro</li>
                <li class="blog__item-arrow">Solibri</li>
                <li class="blog__item-arrow">Tekla</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Companies wanting to embrace BIM should plan to invest resources to find and vet talent. You will also
                need a lot of
                time and money to train your staff.
            </p>
            <p>BIM is a long-term investment. You shouldn’t expect to optimize workload on your first project. Unless,
                of course, you
                hire a BIM service provider.
            </p>

        <li class="blog__item">
            <h3 class="blog__item-title">02 Reliant on cooperation</h3>

            <p>
                Using BIM services requires active engagement and regular input from stakeholders. All parties have to
                be willing to
                invest their time and resources to make a BIM project perform as it should. Your project may face
                complications if one
                of your subcontractors is new to the technology or doesn’t understand the advantages of BIM for
                construction, but there
                is a solution.
            </p>
            <p>
                The right BIM company can offer proven workflow design and cloud solutions to coordinate projects
                remotely and in
                real-time. You’ll be able to coordinate the efforts of your engineers, consultants, designers, and
                architects to improve
                your productivity during all stages of construction.

            <h3 class="blog__item-title">03 Lack of experts</h3>

            <p>
                Creating an accurate BIM model requires in-depth technical skills with various modeling software. You
                also need
                knowledgeable engineering and design professionals to check the compatibility of architectural,
                structural, mechanical,
                electrical, and plumbing systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many BIM design firms can create a 3D model that works on paper. But only qualified experts with
                relevant experience can
                ensure that your construction model is technically feasible.
