  <h2 class="blog__title">What Is BIM Software?</h2>
  <p>
    Building information modeling software goes beyond a particular computer
    program. Rather, it’s a set of digital products that enables AEC
    (architecture, engineering, and construction) professionals to put BIM into
    practice. Using BIM programs and tools, you can:

  <ul class="blog__list in-house__list">
    <li class="blog__item-arrow">
      Generate, view, and manipulate an interactive 3D model that represents the
      physical and functional characteristics of a future facility
    </li>
    <li class="blog__item-arrow">
      Share this 3D model with everyone involved in the building process — from
      architects and MEP engineers to supplies and clients — enabling them to
      work on it at the same time
    </li>
    <li class="blog__item-arrow">
      Test your model under various conditions, such as predicting wind loads,
      ensuring pedestrian comfort, ensuring air quality, preventing
      contamination, etc.
    </li>
    <li class="blog__item-arrow">
      Simulate the construction process to make exact estimations on time,
      materials, manpower and avoid clashes in processes
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Please keep in mind that these are just a few examples of what BIM software
    can do. Still, some of these features, like 3D modeling and collaboration
    capabilities, are a must for the successful implementation of
