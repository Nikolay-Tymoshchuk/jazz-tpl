      <p class="conclusion__text">By implementing the set of Dynamo scripts in the wall framing design process, we
        reduced the time needed to design the framing for one wall from several hours to just a few minutes. Each script
        can be modified in line with the client's requirements for the framing material preferred connections and
        details etc. It takes now much less time to design a high-quality wall framing model that caters to the
        buildingâ€™s specific features. If the wall layout changes, our team can easily adjust the framing design with
        minimum labor hours.</p>
