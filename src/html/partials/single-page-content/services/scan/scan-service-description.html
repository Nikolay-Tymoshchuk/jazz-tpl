      <p class="service-description__text">Many BIM modeling companies create interactive 3D models from flat
        drawings. However, Powerkhâ€™s Point Cloud to BIM modeling services can help you achieve more precise
        results.
      </p>
      <p class="service-description__text">Point Cloud refers to data obtained from scanning three-dimensional objects.
        But the raw data is useless for 3D modeling. Our company, however, can transform your Point Cloud data into
        3D as-built models for any construction project.
