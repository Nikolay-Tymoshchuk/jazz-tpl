      <p class="service-description__text">Most shop drawings and 2D plans contain inaccuracies, and just one oversight
        in the design is enough to halt the project. How can you make sure that your construction documentation doesn’t
        have errors?
      </p>
      <p class="service-description__text">Powerkh can transform your flat drawing into a fully interactive visual 3D
        database with exhaustive information about the project’s architecture, dimensions, materials, and systems.
      </p>
      <p class="service-description__text">You won’t have to worry that a design overlap will lead to corrections and
        costly expenses! We will correct clashes and produce a comprehensible and accurate 3D BIM model for
        engineers, architects, fabricators, and construction teams.
