        <p class="service-process__item-title">The client sends the brief and technical documentation.</p>
        <p class="service-process__item-desc">We discuss minute details of the construction project and analyze
          drawings, 2D plans, blueprints, photos, and visuals references.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="service-process__item">
        <p class="service-process__item-title">We import 2D drawings into the 3D model.</p>
        <p class="service-process__item-desc">Our team transforms flat drawings into a 3D model using Autodesk Revit
          software.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="service-process__item">
        <p class="service-process__item-title">We build the framework and design elements.</p>
        <p class="service-process__item-desc">We digitalize all structural elements — from walls and MEP
          &lpar;mechanical, electrical, and plumbing&rpar; systems to door handles.
          Moreover, we will group objects in data libraries that contain Revit families to simplify stakeholders’
          collaboration.

        <p class="service-process__item-title">Our team identifies inconsistencies.</p>
        <p class="service-process__item-desc">Our team runs clash detection software to find and flag design conflicts.

        <p class="service-process__item-title">We help resolve problems.</p>
        <p class="service-process__item-desc">We will send reports about the flaws in the design and propose solutions.
          Your team members will be able to work on a project simultaneously from a single file.</p>

        <p class="service-process__item-title">The client receives interactive 3D BIM models and shop drawings.</p>
        <p class="service-process__item-desc">You will get accurate fabrication drawings and a fully interactive 3D
          database that can tie construction and manufacturing sites for a significant productivity boost.</p>
