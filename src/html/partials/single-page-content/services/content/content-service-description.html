      <p class="service-description__text">Every object in BIM is a part of the family — a hierarchy of categories that
        comprise all construction elements. BIM families include thousands of model components for the floor,
        walls, doors, stairs, beams, and other elements with varying sizes, shapes, and logical behaviors.
      </p>
      <p class="service-description__text">Revit family model creation is an indispensable part of BIM services
        because it allows manufacturers, designers, engineers, and other stakeholders to adjust object parameters while
        maintaining their logic.
      </p>
      <p class="service-description__text">Professionals use Autodesk Revit software for BIM object library
        creation. However, building an intelligent parametric model for each element requires precision,
        experience, and technical expertise.
