      <p class="service-description__text">Back in the day, design specialists used tracing paper to check the
        compatibility of architectural, structural, and MEP systems. As a result, many clashes become known on-site,
        which leads to re-works, slows projects, and inflates the budget.</p>
      <p class="service-description__text">BIM coordination allows designers to use interactive 3D models to
        eliminate conflicts in design and mitigate risks during the construction phase.</p>
      <p class="service-description__text">Powerkh can evaluate your entire construction according to the projectâ€™s
        documentation, visual references, and technical specifications. Our BIM coordination services include
        clash detection, constructability reviews, coordination meetings, and other solutions to keep your project on
        track.</p>
