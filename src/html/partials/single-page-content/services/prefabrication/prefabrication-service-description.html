      <p class="service-description__text">BIM is an integral part of modular construction. Prefabricated
        &lpar;modular&rpar; construction is a holistic approach that allows teams to produce and assemble any structure
        in components &lpar;&quot;modules&quot;&rpar;. However, the design must be impeccable if you want the parts of
        your construction to fit.
      </p>
      <p class="service-description__text">Thankfully, you can automate most rudimentary processes and get accurate
        virtual prototypes with BIM for prefabrication and fabrication services. Powerkh can create a superset of
        parametric 3D models and shop drawings for all building elements, including the architectural, structural, and
        MEP.

    <p class="service-description__list-title">Our prefabrication BIM services have undeniable advantages for
      architects, engineers, and structural consultants. We can help you improve:</p>

    <ul class="service-description__list">
      <li class="service-description__item"><strong>Turnaround time.</strong> The manufacturing and on-site works happen
        simultaneously in modular construction, improving productivity by up to 50 percent.</li>
      <li class="service-description__item"><strong>Flexibility.</strong> Your project wonâ€™t slow down because of a
        materials shortage or lack of construction specialists with relevant qualifications near your site.</li>
      <li class="service-description__item"><strong>Safety.</strong> Prefabrication construction reduces the risk of
        accidents because most of the work will be done off-site in factory-controlled environments.</li>
      <li class="service-description__item"><strong>Sustainability.</strong> Preplanned assembly cuts down site
        disturbance and the amount of waste produced.</li>
      <li class="service-description__item"><strong>Accuracy.</strong> Prefab BIM modeling delivers 3D models and
        2D drawings for CNC &lpar;Computer Numerical Control&rpar; manufacturing.</li>
    </ul>
